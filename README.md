# ✨ AutoTyper by AS ⌨️ + 🧠 (AI Enhanced)

## Description 📝

AutoTyper by AS is an open-source utility developed to automate text entry tasks 🤖 on your computer. It offers two primary operational modes: a standard **AutoTyper** for the automated reproduction of user-defined text and an advanced **AutoTyper + AI** mode that integrates generative artificial intelligence (powered by Ollama 🦙) to process and rephrase textual content prior to automated typing. This dual functionality renders it a versatile tool suitable for a range of applications, from the efficient execution of repetitive data input to the dynamic generation of revised textual material. 🎉

## ✨ Key Features ✨

**Standard AutoTyper Mode ⌨️:**

*This image showcases the modern and intuitive graphical user interface of the AutoTyper application, highlighting the mode selection mechanism, text input fields, operational buttons.*

* **Intuitive Text Input:** Facilitates straightforward entry of text intended for automated typing. ✍️
* **Adjustable Typing Velocity:** Enables user control over the rate at which text is entered. 💨
* **Incorporation of Typing Variance:** Introduces subtle, randomized variations in typing speed to emulate human-like input. 😉
* **Hotkey-Triggered Operation:** Allows for the initiation and termination of the typing process via a configurable hotkey (`Ctrl+#`). 🕹️
* **Clear Operational Status Indication:** Provides real-time feedback on the application's current state (Ready ✅, Typing Text 🔴, Stopped 🟠, Compiled 🟡).
* **User-Configurable Parameters:** Features a dedicated settings interface for adjusting typing speed and randomness levels. ⚙️

**Enhanced AutoTyper + AI Mode 🧠:**

* **Generative AI Integration (Ollama):** Leverages the Ollama library and a designated language model (`qwen2.5:0.5b` by default) for intelligent text processing. 
* **Contextual Prompting Capability:** Includes a dedicated input field for providing prompts or instructions to guide the AI's processing of the primary text (e.g., "Generate a concise summary of the following text for review purposes:"). 💡
* **Dedicated AI Output Display:** Presents the text generated by the AI model within a specific console area. 👀
* **Automated Typing of AI-Generated Content:** Upon completion of AI processing, the utility automatically types the resulting text. ✨
* **Hotkey-Controlled Activation:** Similar to the standard mode, utilizes `Ctrl+#` to commence and cease the automated typing of AI-processed text. 🕹️
* **Transparent Operational Status:** Offers clear updates on the application's current state. ✅🔴🟠🟡
* **Shared Configuration Settings:** Employs the same settings for typing speed and randomness as the standard mode. ⚙️

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅

* **Python 3.6 or higher:** Ensure that Python is installed on the system. 🐍
* **CustomTkinter Library:** Install for the graphical user interface:
    ```bash
    pip install customtkinter
    ```
* **PyAutoGUI Library:** Install for programmatic control of keyboard and mouse:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui
    ```
* **Keyboard Library:** Install for hotkey management:
    ```bash
    pip install keyboard
    ```
* **Ollama (for AutoTyper + AI mode):**
    * Download and install from the official website: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) 🦙
    * Execute Ollama and retrieve the required language model (e.g., `qwen2.5:0.5b`):
        ```bash
        ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b
        ```
* **Ollama Python Library (for AutoTyper + AI mode):** Install the Python interface for Ollama:
    ```bash
    pip install ollama
    ```

### Installation Procedure 🛠️

1.  If the code is managed under a version control system, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
2.  Alternatively, save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `autotyper.py`). 💾

### Instructions for Use 🕹️

1.  Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python autotyper.py
    ```
2.  **Splash Screen:** A brief loading sequence will be displayed. ⏳
3.  **Main User Interface:**
    * **Mode Selection:** Utilize the dropdown menu at the top to choose between "AutoTyper" and "AutoTyper + AI" modes. ⚙️
    * **Text Input:** Enter or paste the text intended for automation into the primary text area. ✍️
    * **AI Prompt (in AI Mode):** When using "AutoTyper + AI", provide instructions to the AI in the smaller text field above the main input. 🤔
    * **Compilation:** Click the "Compile" button to prepare the text for automation (and initiate AI processing in the enhanced mode). The button will indicate compilation by changing to yellow. 🟡
    * **Status Monitoring:** The button located on the right side of the interface displays the current operational status of the application. ✅➡️🔴➡️🟠
    * **AI Console (in AI Mode):** In "AutoTyper + AI" mode, the output generated by the AI will be shown in this dedicated text area. 👀
    * **Settings Adjustment:** Access the "Settings" panel by clicking the respective button to modify typing speed and randomness. Confirm changes by clicking "Return". ⚙️
4.  **Initiating Automated Typing:** Once the text is compiled and the status indicates "Press Keybind", press `Ctrl+#` in the target application window. ✨
5.  **Terminating Automated Typing:** Press `Ctrl+#` again to halt the ongoing typing process. The status will update to "Stopped". 🛑

## ⚙️ Configuration Settings ⚙️

The settings interface allows for customization of the typing behavior:

* **Speed:** Determines the temporal delay (in seconds) between the input of each character. Lower values correspond to faster typing speeds. 💨
* **Randomness:** Introduces a degree of stochastic variation (up to the specified value in seconds) to the base typing speed, thereby simulating more naturalistic typing patterns. 😉
